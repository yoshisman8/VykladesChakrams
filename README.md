# Outward Mod Template

A template for creating a C# Outward Mod.

## How to use

1. Either clone/download the repository with Git or GitHub Desktop, or simply download the code manually.
2. Open `src/OutwardModTemplate.sln` with any C# IDE (Visual Studio, Rider, etc)
3. Open the `Plugin.cs` file and follow the instructions
4. When you're ready, build the solution. It will be built to the `Release` folder (next to the `src` folder).
5. Take the DLL from the `Release` folder and put it in the `BepInEx/plugins/` folder. If you use r2modman, this can be found by going into r2modman settings and clicking on `Browse Profile Folder`.
